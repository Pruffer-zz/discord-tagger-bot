# discord-tagger-bot
A [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) bot that sends a message with whatever tags it can find on either IQDB (predominantly with Danbooru), or SauceNao with Gelbooru, for every uploaded file that it can see.

Change variables at the start of `main.py` to use with your own server / bot.

Might be useful for integration with my [file downloader bot](https://github.com/Pruffer/discord-file-downloader-bot).
